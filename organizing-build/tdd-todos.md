# Test-driving development

A key element of TDD is keeping focus on what's in front of you. To this effect I typically keep a list of todos. Since I'm planning on working on this project solo, I'm just keeping a single todo list here. It has two sections: a semi-ordered section for my current foucs, and a place I can offload the good ideas I have that aren't suited for my current focus.

## Current Focus: Slice 0 Annoying Setup

- [x] Evaluate plasmo: https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/plasmo (yes~~/no~~; now~~/later~~)
  - [x] install plasmo
  - [x] make a hello world message
  - [â€¢] change icon used
  - [x] install tailwind
- [x] I want to TDD
  - [x] Set up testing environment (vitest, testing-library)
  - [x] Configure test runners and scripts
  - [x] Write first component test
- [ ] Test drive a hello world
  - [x] Hello twits! on extension page
  - [ ] Hello twits! injected into specific pages
- [ ] Set up E2E testing
