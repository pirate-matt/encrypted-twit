# Test-driving development

A key element of TDD is keeping focus on what's in front of you. To this effect I typically keep a list of todos. Since I'm planning on working on this project solo, I'm just keeping a single todo list here. It has two sections: a semi-ordered section for my current foucs, and a place I can offload the good ideas I have that aren't suited for my current focus.

## Current Focus: Slice 0 Annoying Setup

- [ ] I want to TDD
  - thinking vite, playwright, testing-library
- [ ] Evaluate plasmo: https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/plasmo (yes/no; now/later)
- [ ] Test drive a hello world
  - [ ] Hello world on extension page
  - [ ] Hello world injected into current page
