# Generative AI Context Directory

Generative AI coding assistants are incredibly powerful and getting better quickly. One way to maximize benefit is to provide updated context as they are often trained on historical data. This directory is a place to store such context: updated API/client documentation, tutorials, etc.

Keep this place organized by directory or mega files.
